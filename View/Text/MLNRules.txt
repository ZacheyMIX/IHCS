Upload a .mln file for your dataset.

Format:

List predicates (e.g., HasName(Employee, Name))

List error flags (e.g., BadName(Employee))

Write detection rules (e.g., 0.8 HasName(e, name), RegexMatch(name, ".[0-9]+.") => BadName(e))

Use RegexMatch to validate fields.
Predicates → Flags → Rules (in that order).
