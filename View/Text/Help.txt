In order to use this program you will need a dirty dataset in the form of a CSV file which you will input into the program.  Then you will decide upon the rules in which how the dataset will be cleaned, or you can allow the program to generate the rules for you.  Afterward you will iniatiate the cleaning process which you can then view in real time.  After the cleaning is finished you can evaluate and interact with the results.  Evaluation allows you to view the runtime and accuracy of the cleaning process.  And the interaction allows you to compare results with the original dataset which you can then decide if you want to keep certain values from the original set. Once you have decided on your new dataset, you can finally download it back as another csv file.
