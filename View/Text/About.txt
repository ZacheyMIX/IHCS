IHCS is a data cleaning tool that processes raw, inconsistent data using a Markov Logic Network (MLN) rule-based system. The program takes an input file containing dirty data, applies MLN-driven cleaning rules, and presents the results to the user in real-time. During the cleaning process, users can review and validate the changes before finalizing the output. After cleaning, IHCS provides a comparative analysis, allowing users to evaluate the cleaned data alongside the original dataset to ensure accuracy and completeness
